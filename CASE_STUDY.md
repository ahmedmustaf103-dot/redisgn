## Executive Summary

A concept redesign of [waten.com](https://www.waten.com/) built to demonstrate how a refreshed structure, clearer hierarchy, and stronger conversion elements could support Waten's growth in Saudi Arabia's real estate market.

---

## Before & After

### Before (Original Site)

- Minimal structure — single page, limited sections
- No clear CTAs beyond basic "Read More" links
- No dedicated The Team or Why Waten sections
- No project filtering or search
- No Arabic / RTL support
- No floating contact CTA
- Limited trust elements (testimonials, company metrics)

### After (Redesign)

- **Clear hierarchy** — Hero → Why Waten → About → Projects → Trust → Team → Contact → FAQ
- **Primary CTAs** — "Explore Projects" and "Contact Us for Investment Opportunities"
- **The Team section** — Placeholder for leadership, development, operations
- **Why Waten** — Benefit-driven section with icons (Transparency, Quality, Innovation, Kingdom-Wide)
- **Project filter** — City, type, status filters + property search bar
- **Trust elements** — Company metrics (15+ years, 12+ projects), testimonials, partner logos placeholder
- **Arabic / RTL** — Language toggle; Hero, Nav, Footer, Contact translated
- **Floating CTA** — "Contact Us" button appears on scroll
- **Sticky header** — Fixed nav with brand colours
- **Exact brand palette** — #E9E1D2 (primary bg), #F5F1E8 (cards), #111111 (text), #3A332A (accent/buttons)

## Tech Stack & Performance

- **Tailwind CSS** — Easy for team or developer to adjust styling
- **Lazy loading** — Images load on scroll for faster initial load
- **Responsive** — Mobile-first; works across devices
- **Form** — Wired to Formspree (add `VITE_FORMSPREE_ID` env var to receive submissions)
- **Static build** — Deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or any host; no backend required

## Handoff & Next Steps

1. **Form submissions** — Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io), create a form, add `VITE_FORMSPREE_ID` to Vercel env vars
2. **Analytics** — Add Google Tag Manager or GA4 snippet to `index.html` (placeholder comment included)
3. **Team content** — Replace placeholder team photos and bios with real data
4. **Partner logos** — Add real partner logos in Trust Elements
5. **Arabic copy** — Review and refine Arabic translations with a native speaker
6. **Social links** — Update Footer social URLs to Waten's real profiles

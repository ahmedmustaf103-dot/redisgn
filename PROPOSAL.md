# Concept Redesign — Waten Real Estate

**Live preview:** [Add your Vercel URL, e.g. https://redisgn-five.vercel.app]

---

A responsive concept redesign of [waten.com](https://www.waten.com/) built with React and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to keep your brand, message, and content while improving structure, clarity, and conversion.

---

## What stayed the same

- **Branding** — Logo, tagline (“Urban Spaces, Elevated.”), header imagery
- **Copy** — Saudi-based, commercial & residential, excellence, sustainability, transparency, quality, innovation
- **Projects** — Murabbaa Residence, Plaza Dan, Princess Sara (links to your project pages)
- **Contact** — Olaya office address and Hello@waten.com

---

## What was improved

1. **Hero** — Stronger value proposition + primary CTAs (“Explore Projects”, “Contact Us for Investment Opportunities”)
2. **Why Waten** — Benefit-driven section with icons, placed under hero
3. **The Team** — Dedicated section (placeholder for real names/photos)
4. **Featured Projects** — Location tags, type/status metadata, filter UI (city/type/status), property search bar
5. **Trust elements** — Company metrics (15+ years, 12+ projects), testimonials, partner logos placeholder
6. **Arabic / RTL** — Language toggle; key sections translated
7. **Floating CTA** — “Contact Us” button appears on scroll
8. **Sticky header** — Fixed nav with brand colours
9. **Contact form** — Wired to Formspree (add env var to receive submissions)
10. **Exact brand palette** — #E9E1D2, #F5F1E8, #111111, #3A332A

---

## Tech stack

- **React + Vite** — Fast, modern front end
- **Tailwind CSS** — Easy to adjust styling and branding
- **Static build** — Host on Vercel, Netlify, or any host
- **Formspree** — Contact form sends to your email (add `VITE_FORMSPREE_ID` in env)

---

## Next steps I can help with

- **Hand off** — Clean codebase, README, optional call to walk your team through structure
- **Deploy** — Live on a URL you can share (e.g. waten.com subdomain)
- **Content** — Swap in real team photos, partner logos, refine Arabic copy
- **Analytics** — Set up GTM/GA4 for form submits and CTA clicks
- **Ongoing support** — Trial period or retainer to iterate based on feedback

*This is an unsolicited concept redesign to show how a refreshed structure could support Waten's growth. I’m happy to discuss how we can work together.*

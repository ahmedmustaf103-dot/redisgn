# Concept Redesign — Waten Real Estate

**Live preview:** [Add your deployed link here]

A responsive concept redesign of [waten.com](https://www.waten.com/) built with React and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to keep your brand, message, and content while improving structure, clarity, and conversion.

## What stayed the same

- **Branding** — Your logo, tagline (“Urban Spaces, Elevated.”), and header imagery
- **Copy** — All existing messaging: Saudi-based, commercial & residential, excellence, sustainability, transparency, quality, innovation
- **Projects** — Murabbaa Residence, Plaza Dan, Princess Sara, with links to your current project pages
- **Contact** — Olaya office address and Hello@waten.com

---

## What was improved

1. **The Team** — A dedicated section for your team (currently placeholders). Your current site has “The Team” in the nav; this gives it a clear home and makes it easy to add real names and photos later.

2. **Clear next step** — A footer strip (“Ready to elevate your space?”) with a Contact CTA so visitors have an obvious action before they leave.

3. **Layout and hierarchy** — Clear sections, consistent spacing, and a single-column flow so the story (who you are → what you do → projects → why you → team → contact) is easy to follow on mobile and desktop.

4. **Contact** — Address and email shown next to the form so visitors can reach you even without submitting.

## Tech stack

- **React** + **Vite** — Fast, modern front end
- **Tailwind CSS** — Easy for your team or a developer to adjust styling and branding
- **Static build** — Can be hosted on Vercel, Netlify, or any host; no backend required for the current form (can be wired to your email or CRM later)

---

## Next steps I can help with

- **Hand off** — Clean codebase, README, and optional call to walk your team through structure and how to edit content
- **Deploy** — Get this live on a URL you can share (e.g. waten-redesign.vercel.app or a subdomain you prefer)
- **Content** — Swap in real team photos and bios, or tweak copy to match your latest positioning
- **Arabic / RTL** — Add Arabic and right-to-left layout if you want the site to be bilingual

*This is an unsolicited concept redesign to show how a refreshed structure could support Waten’s growth. I’m happy to discuss how we can work together.*
